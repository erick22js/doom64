		<h1>Segs</h1>
		
		<p>Segs is a abbreviation for segments and represents the structure part of a subsector. The segments are a result of a BSP generation by multiples splits in the map (did by a map editor), each segment is owned by a single subsector, linedef and sidedef.</p>
		
		<h1>Structure</h1>
		
		<p>The direction field can have two values: 0 if the segment runs along the front side (or "right") of the linedef or 1 if the segment runs along the back side (or "left") of the linedef.</p>
